This codebase is the remake of CRM HOMSTUDENT (Property Pro) in Laravel, React, React Route, Tailwind and modern frontend UX/UI tecnologies from scratch.

This codebase is the fundamental remake of the old codebase of this CRM that was made in a messy way from a developer before me in pure PHP (that itself is not a real mistake) with a lot of bugs, security issues, redundancies and architectural problems.

Then all the view were made with all the PHP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS inside, a real mess.

APIs and Views were positioned in the same folder, so even the files were not organized by responsibility in their respective folder.

# I've documented the mess of the old project
You can find the documented mess of the old project here:
- "documentation/OLD_PROJECT.md"

Then, I've taken screenshots of UX/UI, design, layout and tabs of the OLD CRM to pass them to AI assistants I use. This to destructure everything into steps and to remake or reorganize the old UI. You can find images here:
- "documentation/old_project_images/old_crm_clients_tab.png"

# How to understand everything about the development of this project
During the remake of this project I documented everything: during the development, debugging, restructuring, database redesign, frontend redesign, restructuring layouts, UX, UI, API redesign and everything of this project.

You can find the main entry file inside:
- "documentation/DEVELOPMENT.md"

You can find debugging procedures and commands inside:
- "documentation/DEBUG.md"

You can find API documentation inside:
- "documentation/API_DOCUMENTATION.md"

And some steps about the development of this CRM sections here:
- Calendar page development "documentation/calendar/CALENDAR_DEVELOPMENT.md"
- Calendar page improvements "documentation/calendar/CALENDAR_IMPROVEMENTS.md"

Enter those documentation to understand this project and how we're gone so far.
